BugzillaMigrate
===============

bzmigrate.pl is a Perl program to parse the XML output of Bugzilla
(2.22 onward?) into structures suitable for programmatic upload to a new bug
tracker; initally targeting GitHub Issues (v3).

You can create an XML dump from Bugzilla by searching for the appropriate bugs,
and hitting the XML button at the bottom of the page - the output from which
will contain the full specification of all bugs shown.

The script inputs values from environment variables and/or command line options.
If run with -i option, it can also prompt for the values interactively.

Note that Github Issues API does not currently allow attaching files
programatically so the script at least prints its IDs and filenames.

The script assumes that the repo has labels "bug" and "enhancement".
